## GameJs

Setup
-------
Install RingoJs, the Web Serving Application we use. It needs Java, see:

    http://ringojs.org/wiki/Getting_Started/

Get ringo-gamejs from github:

   git clone http://github.com/oberhamsi/ringo-gamejs.git

GameJs and the applications written written by you are CommonJs Modules.

Usage
------
Try the demo apps that can be found in the `examples` directory of GameJs. Start GameJs by starting the ringo-gamejs web application:

   cd ringo-gamejs/app/
   ringo-web
   
and go to http://localhost/

You can start digging around by modifying the code in `examples`. If you want to write and serve a fresh app simply add it's path information to `export.apps` in `ringo-gamejs/app/config.js` - there's an example for how to do that right there.
