## GameJs
GameJs is a library for writing 2D games or other interactive graphic applications for the HTML Canvas. Its API is modeled after the successfully PyGame.

  * API http://gamejs.org/api/

Setup
-------
Install RingoJs. GameJs is a Ringo app. Once you have Ringo installed the other components are easy
to get with Ringo's package managment.

More details on how to install Ringo can be found here:

    http://ringojs.org/wiki/Getting_Started/

Once you have Ringo installed get the two necessary Ringo packages with `ringo-admin`:

   ringo-admin install hns/ringo-modulr
   ringo-admin install oberhamsi/ringo-gamejs

Start the GameJs web interface:

   ringo-web ~/ringojs/packages/ringo-gamejs/app/config.js
   
.. and access it in your browser:
   
   http://localhost:8080/

A couple of example apps should show up.

Usage
------
Checkout the example apps that can be found in the `apps` directory of GameJs. Copy one of them to get started - your new app should automatically show up in the GameJs web interface.

`app/config.js` is only interesting if your game is networked since you'll have to instantiate a NetworkController for the game in there.
