## GameJs

Setup
-------
Install RingoJs. Once you have Ringo installed the other components are easy
since Ringo has package managment. More details on how to install Ringo can be found here:

    http://ringojs.org/wiki/Getting_Started/

Once you have Ringo installed pull the rest of the requirements:

   ringo-admin install hns/ringo-modulr
   ringo-admin install oberhamsi/ringo-gamejs

You should then be able to startup the GameJs server with

   ringo-web ~/ringojs/packages/ringo-gamejs/app/config.js

Usage
------
Checkout the example apps that can be found in the `apps` directory of GameJs. Copy one of them to get started. `app/config.js` is only interesting if your game is networked since you'll have to instantiate a NetworkController for the game in there.
