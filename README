## GameJs
GameJs is a library for writing 2D games or other interactive graphic applications for the HTML Canvas. Its API is modeled after the successfully PyGame.

GameJs' killer feature is easy networking (work in progress).

Setup
-------
GameJs is a Ringo application. Once you have Ringo installed the other components
are easy to get with Ringo's package managment.

Details on how to install Ringo:

    http://ringojs.org/wiki/Getting_Started/

Once you have Ringo get the two necessary Ringo packages with `ringo-admin`:

   ringo-admin install hns/ringo-modulr
   ringo-admin install oberhamsi/ringo-gamejs

Start the GameJs web interface:

   ringo-web ~/ringojs/packages/ringo-gamejs/app/config.js
   
.. and access it in your browser:
   
   http://localhost:8080/

A couple of example apps should show up.

Usage
------
Every GameJs app lives in its own directory below `apps/`. `main.js` in such an app directory is called by GameJs to bootstrap your game in the browser.

A couple of example apps are provided to get you started. Also checkout the API http://gamejs.org/api/
