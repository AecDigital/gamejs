GameJs
=======

GameJs is a JavaScript library for writing 2D games or other interactive graphic applications for the HTML Canvas. Its API is modeled after the successful PyGame <http://pygame.org> library.

  * Powerful, proven, and thin abstraction for 2D
  * Sane JavaScript! With CommonJs support
  * Runs in modern browsers
  * optional server-side integration with RingoJs <http://ringojs.org>

The API will change though it will converge to a sensible translation of PyGame concepts to JavaScript.

Install
========

If you downloaded a release just unzip the files.

Developer Version
----------------------------------

You need:

  * Java 1.5+
  * git and ant
